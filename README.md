## 4. System Design

The main reason people struggle with System Design interviews isn’t because they haven’t read enough case studies or designed enough systems. It’s because they haven’t built a strong understanding of the basics.

It’s easy to get excited about advanced topics like designing distributed databases, scalable microservices, or messaging systems. But the truth is, these are not as common as they seem.

Instead, focus on getting the fundamentals right. These are the building blocks that every system is built on, and they’ll help you confidently handle any design problem during interviews.
